  <h1>Hello</h1>
  <p>
    2025/01/06 - I haven't maintained this webpage in a long time because of the rising (and absurd) cost of hosting. It seems that every single webhosting service now fully expects that you are only starting a website for commerical purposes. For monetary gain. My website has been a monetary loss only, for many years. Traffic has always been too low to ever reap any benefit, which is totally expected; I started my website as a niche thing, to appeal to other screwballs looking for information on high voltage electrical experiements and crafting jewelry out of junk -- two of my old passtimes. </p>
  <p>
    I am writing this in pure html. Do you remember when websites were simply a way to share information? Often they were just text. Then pictures happened. OK, I used to make animated GIFs of the sprites from DOOM and put them on a Geocities site with disco music. It was fun. Then the internet stopped being fun. It really sucks now. Sometimes I want to share some information, or maby just a thought, and I'll post it on social media and you know what happens when you do that: the algorythm buries it. <strong>Especially</strong> if it is a <u>thoguht</u>. Thoughts are dangerous -- watch this reel of an AI sasquatch cursing * Lose weight and lengthen your penis with this one simple trick!!! * You've been eating a banana wrong your entire life!...and so on.</p>
  <p>
    Anyway. New year, new 1993-style webpage, baby!
