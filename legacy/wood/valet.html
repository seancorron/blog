<p class="body">W.W.K.K. - Wallet, Watch, Knife, Keys. That used to be how I checked myself for the appropriate equipage before venturing out into the world. As time passed, I replaced the pocket watch with a cellphone, and so the mnemonic device no longer serves, however my pocket contents still require a resting place at the end off the day. I used to designate one corner of my dresser for the small articles I carried about daily, however I feared the constant dropping of keys and change onto the wood must eventually lead to scarring. To rectify the situation, I made this dresser valet.</p>

<p class="body">I employed cedar as the body of the dresser valet, finishing the wood only with paste wax. The piece was long-completed before I learned to cut box and dovetail joints, and even before I learned to dowel a butt joint; therefore, I used nails. A channel routed in the wood holds a 1/4" piece of edge-polished glass, overtop a fabric covered panel which merely serves as decoration; both slide out independantly, which allows photos or notes to be inserted between the two.</p>

<p class="body">The skull was not planned, it merely happened. The bell curve of the back board reminded me of the classic bicorne pirate hat (more accurately, the <i>cartoon</i> version of said hat), so the skull - never far from my mind, it would seem - immediately suggested itself. I shallowly carved the skull into the wood using various knives and a Dremel.</p>

<p class="body">The rear of the valet best shows the dramatic contrast between the heartwood and sapwood. Cedar is a beautiful, luminous wood, easy to carve and well suited for items such as this.</p>
