<hr/>  


<p class="body">Occasionally, I buy wire of different metals to make a special piece, or simply to assume a new challenge. The bracelet pictured below was definitely challenging. The rings which make the chain are half niobium and half tungsten.</p>

<p class="body">Niobium is an absolute joy to work, and a beautiful metal. It does not tarnish (instead forming a  clear passivating layer like aluminum), is soft enough to shape and cut easily, but hard enough to resist scratches and to take a high-luster polish. The metal weighs about the same as copper, and so has a nice heft to it and does not feel cheap like titanium or aluminum.</p>

<p class="body">Tungsten is the most stubborn, mallevolent, demon metal I have ever worked. I have cut stainless and high-carbon steels with my jewelers saw, but the tungsten rings in this bracelet had to be cut with a diamond wheel because the saw would not scratch it. When I tried to bend the tungsten rings (no easy feat), most of them broke apart, or splintered into little strands. Each ring had to be closed in the flame of a propane torch to prevent breaking! Needless to say, it was uncomfortable. Nevertheless, I was in the end victorious, and incorporated tungsten into this bracelet.</p>

<p class="body">Tungsten has some interesting physical properties, including weighing almost exactly as much as gold, which is more than twice the weight of copper and around 70% heavier than lead! The heft of tungsten is truly satisfying. It also possesses one of the highest melting points of all the pure elements: 6192 &degF. Because this property makes the metal almost impossible to melt and cast, it is commonly sintered into shape; that is, the powdered metal is subjected to great heat and pressure until it bonds together. </p>
