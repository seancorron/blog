<hr/>  

	<p class="body">Canes, or walking sticks, were once considered an essential part of a gentleman's wardrobe; in addition to the support they provided for balance, canes were a fashion accessory, a symbol of wealth, and an occasional weapon. Dismayed at the utilitarian crudeness of most canes sold today, I decided to craft a stick fit for a gentleman.</p>

<p class="body">The shaft of this cane is stained cherry, 1" in diameter. Flush with the shaft is a brass sleeve extending roughly one-third of the way down the cane. The head is a piece of turned white mulberry, and the foot is a rubber-tipped brass ferrule. </p>

<p class="body">The head is definitely the focus of the cane. I 'turned' (though I did not use a lathe) a well-seasoned piece of mulberry until it filled the palm of the hand comfortably. The mulberry had some checking from uneven drying, which I filled in the same way as on my <a href="../weapons/club.html">Shillelagh</a>, using brass filings, instead, as a filler material.</p>

<p class="body">Mulberry is a seldom used wood in North America, though I understand it is more popular in the Orient. The wood is extremely dense and hard, and polishes well. Freshly cut, the wood is a luminous yellow, but in the open air it quickly ages to a dark, orangish-brown, as seen above. There is neither stain, nor finish on this wood; the color and sheen are entirely natural.</p>

<p class="body">Most canes I have seen for sale have either had large, rubber caps over the end, giving them a purely orthopaedic look, or a metal ferrule for outdoor use. The all-rubber tips are ugly and coarse, while the metal tips are dangerous to use on - and destructive to - smooth floors. My solution was to combine the best points of both styles. The brass tip is glued to the cane shaft, while the rubber foot is fastened by a screw which passes into the shaft. The rubber bumper is a common piece found in hardware stores for attachment to furniture, meaning that when it wears through (and it will), replacement will be simple and cheap.</p>
