<p class="body">When my cousin announced the imminent birth of his last daughter, the family showered him and his wife with baby gifts. Having rather more time and talent than money, I decided to make a gift. Both parents being hunters, I thought a "baby's first hunting knife" would be appropriate.</p>

<p class="body">The blade of this knife is made from a file too dull to be used for its intended purpose. Files are often made from uncomplicated carbon steel alloys such as W-1 and make perfect knife blades when the temper is slightly drawn. I did no forge-shaping on the blade, only stock-removal via the belt grinder.</p>

<p class="body">The overall length of the knife is approximately six inches - enough for an adult to wrap, perhaps, three fingers around the handle. The handle is stained curly maple finished with a linseed oil based varnish. I fashioned the guard from scratch out of brass barstock.</p>

<p class="body">In addition to the knife being the finest I have made to date, the sheath is also some of my best leatherwork. I used numerous varied techniques to "tool" the leather, and stained it with the same homemade mixture described elsewhere on this website.</p>

<p class="body">The knife fits snugly in the sheath; both are perfectly funtional, though perhaps not overly practical. The sheath style is based upon those often found with German-made bowies and hunting knives, and could, technically be worn on a belt, but it would have to be a rather diminutive one.</p>
