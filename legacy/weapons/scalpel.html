<p class="body">The methods used for the shaping of hand-made knife blades can be divided into two categories: forging and stock-removal. Forging involves heating the steel until malleable so that it can be hammered into shape. The stock-removal method begins with a piece of barstock, from which material is removed via grinding or cutting until the blade is the desired shape. Many hand-made knives, like the one below, use a combination of the two methods of shaping. </p>

<p class="body">This is the first knife I successfully forged. It began as a piece of 1/2" O1 toolsteel barstock. O1 is an oil-hardening steel, a very simple alloy, and very forgiving in forging. Even so, hot forging high-carbon steel can be tricky: If the steel is worked too cold, it can crack, especially when quenched in hardening; if worked too hot, carbon begins to burn out of the steel and excess scale develops. Finding the right temperature at which to work the steel is vital, and I am pleased to say that I got it right on this knife.</p>

<p class="body">My inspiration for the design was, of course, the medical scalpel. I thought that a small, concealable knife with a deep belly would make an efficient tool for last-ditch self defense, as well as being useful for field dressing animals in an emergency situation.</p>

<p class="body">The handle is obviously integral with the blade. Ridges carved at the ricasso are designed to be held between the thumb and forefigner, providing positive grip during the pull-cut to which the blade lends itself.</p>
