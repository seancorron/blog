    <img src="me-s.jpg" alt="Me" align="left" height="400" width="300" /><small><p class="body">I should not talk so much about myself if there were anybody else whom I knew as well. Unfortunately, I am confined to this theme by the narrowness of my experience. Moreover, I, on my side, require of every writer, first or last, a simple and sincere account of his own life, and not merely what he has heard of other men’s lives; some such account as he would send to his kindred from a distant land; for if he has lived sincerely, it must have been in a distant land to me. Perhaps these pages are more particularly addressed to poor students. As for the rest of my readers, they will accept such portions as apply to them. I trust that none will stretch the seams in putting on the coat, for it may do good service to him whom it fits.</p><br><p class="body" align="right"> -Henry David Thoreau</p></small>

    <p class="body">I have worked for the Virginia Community College System for all of my substantive career history, having served at Northern Virginia Community College, the Shared Services Center, and currently, the System Office. My role (as of January 2022) is that of Business System Analyst, wherein I troubleshoot, configure and develop our PeopleSoft enterprise systems, and assist in IT project work.</p>

	<p class="body">This gallery of my work was created only with the intent to share. I learned many of the skills and crafts I employ by studying websites such as this, so I wanted to give back, perhaps teaching, or inspiring others. I have noticed that the internet has gone from a collection of unique, personal, often obscure websites with original content, to a cesspool of memes and content-mill trash. I will maintain this webstie as long as I am able, to combat that trend.</p>
