<h1><B>Facebook: The Suicide Network</B></h1>
<h6>by Sean Corron (who is feelin' fine)</h6>

<div class=facebook>
<P>Be honest with yourself: Does it hurt
your self-esteem &ndash; maybe just a little? &ndash; when you post a
photo or status update to Facebook that garners not one comment from
the hundreds of people on your Friends list, nor even a single
'like'? 
</P>

<P>In an uncharacteristic display of
transparency last week, Facebook revealed some of the inner workings
of its News Feed algorithms:
<A HREF="https://www.facebook.com/facebookforbusiness/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed">https://www.facebook.com/facebookforbusiness/news/News-Feed-FYI-A-Window-Into-News-Feed</A>
</P>

<P>While the official news release is uninteresting in itself, the implications of the confessions therein confirm what many people have long suspected: Facebook is a popularity contest. That is, the more people who 'like' your status, the more likely it will be shown in friends' News Feeds (which is the only part of Facebook that many people bother viewing). If a status update elicits a 'hide' from too many people (which is now 'I don't want to see this'), it will be very unlikely that the item will show up at all. Remember that: if you opt to 'hide' a friend's status update, you are influencing whether other people see it as well. 
</P>

<P>Your interaction with other people's
posts does not even have to be as emphatic as a 'like' or 'hide'; if
you simply click on a person's name to view their profile, you are
creating data which Facebook uses to decide how popular the person
is, and thus, whether or not to show their posts on your News Feed,
and others'. 
</P>

<P>From my own personal research, even
such subtle data as how actively you use Facebook can have a huge
impact on whether you are visible to your Friends (which I capitalize
to denote the people on your Friends list, many of whom are probably
acquaintances at best). With the cooperation of a few friends (who
are also Facebook Friends) I observed which posts of my own they
could see in their News Feeds. Prior to the experiment, I had made
very infrequent status updates for several weeks, and few comments on
the status updates of others as well. Over the course of a few days,
I posted several status updates and photos, and at first, my friends
could not see any of them in their News Feeds. If they actively
sought out my profile page, the updates were visible on my Timeline,
but the Facebook algorithms did not chose to show those updates on
their News Feeds. 
</P>

<P>As the second part of the experiment, I
made an organized effort to visit other people's profiles, click on
their links, 'like' things, and comment on items; my friends, in
turn, rifled through my profile (looked at my posts, Friends, photos,
etc.), 'liked' my updates, and commented on them, and slowly, my
posts began to appear on their News Feeds. In a few days, I
apparently even looked somewhat popular to Facebook, because my older
status updates showed up in their News Feeds, and other people on my
Friends list began commenting and 'liking' my posts too. 
</P>

<P>The results of my little experiment
then are these: First, the more popular you are on Facebook, the more
popular Facebook will make you; if people click your photos, 'like'
and comment upon your updates, then Facebook will promote you in your
Friends' News Feed. Conversely, if you are unpopular on Facebook, the
algorithms will hide you away in a corner so as not to harsh the buzz
of your Friends who are having a marvelous time on the exciting
ego-stroke they get from constantly posting the trivialities of their
day. No experiment is even required to prove this one. We all have a
Friend who posts tons of crap (in the form or pithy quotes, or cutesy
photos) whom we 'hide' from our News Feed; do this enough times, and
you won't see them anymore. Think about how many Friends you have
that you no longer see in your News Feed. 
</P>

<P>Businesses already know much of this.
If you search Google for tips on promoting a business page on
Facebook, you will find a great deal of advice on making sure your
posts do not elicit 'hides,' and a warning not to flood your page
with status updates, lest your fans and followers abandon ship, or
worse, block all your posts because they are too frequent.  These
negative responses create data that Facebook algorithms use to decide
that you are less popular, and thus, your business will show up less
frequently in News Feeds and advertising.  
</P>

<P>While the algorithms that Facebook has
developed are extremely complex, and the Big Brother of social
networks did not actually reveal very much last week, the logical
extension of what we now know is disturbing, to say the least. I have
noticed on my own News Feed, that Friends I have not interacted with
on Facebook in years will suddenly reappear when they get engaged or
married. Facebook has even prompted me to send them a gift card,
directly beneath the joyous status update, which means, obviously,
that Facebook can discern the content of a status update; not too
difficult to program a computer to recognize the word &ldquo;engaged.&rdquo;
 However, Facebook is more clever than that by far. In an example
from my own News Feed, a Friend posted only the message, &ldquo;She
said yes!&rdquo; and a photo of a ring-adorned hand. Facebook asked
if I would like to send them an engagement gift. Even more chilling,
Facebook's facial recognition will often ask me if I would like to
tag so-and-so in a photo. As innocuous as Facebook may appear to
many, if an artificial intelligence should ever spring spontaneously
from a computer system, it will be Facebook. &lt;/digression&gt;</P>

<P>The fact that privacy is an illusion was established back in May when Snowden blew the whistle,
but that's not the point I am driving at in this article; it's just a
fact of the world today. The most disquieting thing about Facebook is
not that it gathers personal data about hundreds of millions of
people, nor even the ethically bankrupt way in which the company
often seems to deal with that information, but the psychological
effects that the Facebook algorithms have on users. 
</P>

<P>A number of <a href="http://warhol.wiwi.hu-berlin.de/~hkrasnova/Ongoing_Research_files/WI%202013%20Final%20Submission%20Krasnova.pdf">scientific studies</a> and <a href="http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/promoting-hope-preventing-suicide/201102/does-facebook-make-us-sad">psychological articles</a> have already discussed &ldquo;Facebook Depression&rdquo; (Google it) and the negative effects that social networking sites can have on users. Cyber-bullying has been exposed by the mainstream media, and indeed, the potential for people to use their Facebook accounts to overtly or subconsciously build themselves up while tearing down others is high; but people don't need Facebook to do that. The truly horrifying thing about Facebook &ndash; which has been partly confirmed by the company itself thanks to last week's little peek into their News Feed algorithms &ndash; is that Facebook encourages this behavior! 
</P>

<P>Recall my experiment, above; the cool
kids get constant positive reinforcement because Facebook shows their
status updates to all their Friends, meaning more 'likes,' which in
turn make the user more popular to the News Feed algorithms, which
results in an upward spiral to stardom! Researchers have shown that
looking at other people's status updates &ndash; which frequently
show a positive personal bias &ndash; have immediate negative effects
on a person's self-worth. But when you are already a Facebook hit,
all you have to do to reinforce your ego is to post something, which
will then be broadcast to hundreds of Friends who will 'like' you.  
</P>

<P>Imagine the opposite scenario: a person
who is already depressed, or has low self-esteem, is less likely to
post, less likely to have hundreds of Friends, and less likely to
'like' other people's boastful status updates about all the good
things in their life. This makes that person uncool in the eyes of
Facebook's merciless algorithms, which means that even when they do
post something, it goes unseen. Fragile self-esteem is shattered as
hours and days pass with the status update ignored, not because their
Friends do not like it, but because they never saw it in their News
Feeds. The downward spiral of being unpopular on  Facebook is no
different than that of being unpopular in real life. 
</P>

<P>Past experience has also suggested to
me that negative status updates go unanswered and positive ones are
rewarded with 'likes' and comments. Without polling everybody on my
Friends list, it is impossible to say whether this is just human
nature or also due to Facebook's meddling with what we see in our
News Feed, but I suspect the latter. Facebook has shown itself
capable of recognizing human faces in photographs, and subtle
language cues as to the content of status updates, so I strongly
suspect that the same algorithms that are more likely to show me an
engagement announcement from someone with whom I seldom interact, are
also less likely to show me negative posts from Friends who are
having a bad day and complaining about it. Too bad, because
those are the very people who could use an encouraging word or two;
but then, who would want a Friend's bad day to bring them down?</P>

<P>The internet is not, as it was once touted, an impartial forum allowing everybody to have their voice, a place where real-life social misfits could be heard, but more like the harsh, cliquish halls of highschool, all because Facebook has written complex programs to determine what people like to see, and
showing it to them. Is it any wonder that Facebook bullying has been cited as a factor in recent teen <a href="http://www.thedailybeast.com/witw/articles/2013/05/31/will-italy-sue-facebook-over-cyberbullying-suicide.html">suicides</a>? The website has emulated all the  ugliness of survival-of-the-fittest social interaction, with computer precision, but left out the seed of change, the only thing that makes us more than hairless apes vying for rank: human compassion.  
</P>

<P>It scares me to think about someone who is socially isolated and depressed, and their only way of reaching out is via Facebook; a scenario much more common, I think, than many would admit. 
</P>

<P>What if your last message to the world were a status update that nobody saw? 
</P>
